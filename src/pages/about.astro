      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Climate change requires solutions at every level â€” from individual actions to global initiatives. But too often, these efforts happen in isolation. People want to help, but don't know where to start. Great projects need funding, but struggle to reach supporters. Technology exists to solve problems, but lacks the community to implement it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Earthject bridges these gaps, creating an ecosystem where passion meets purpose, and small actions combine to create massive change.

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Hi, I'm **Janelle**, the founder of Earthject. Like many people, I often felt overwhelmed by the scale of environmental and social issues. I saw countless documentaries and read countless articles, but I was left wondering, "What can I, as one person, actually do?"
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        I realized that the feeling of helplessness was a common thread. So, I started building Earthject as a solutionâ€”a way to turn that feeling of frustration into a force for good.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        This isn't just a platform for me; it's for everyone who wants to be part of the solution. It's a testament to what we can achieve when we stop feeling powerless and start acting powerfully, together.
